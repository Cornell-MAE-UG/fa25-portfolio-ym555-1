For a class, we were asked to design a simple lift system using an actuator attached to the bar. Our design space was limited to 150cm long and 50cm tall. Our desgin requirements included a ridig bar, of a fixed length, 3 pin supports (2 of which needed to be mounted on the ground), and a linear actuator (picked from a list of catalog).
