For this assignment, I used the heat exchanger lab as a real-world instance to show how energy is transferred. 
The setup of this system included:
Heat exchanger, where the energy transfer occurred
Pumps, which moved the liquid up through the pipes 
Pipes, which held the liquid that moved from the initial container through the heat exchanger, then to the final tub
Cold water, dyed blue
Hot water, dyed red
Containers to hold the water

Here is a visual setup of the system:
