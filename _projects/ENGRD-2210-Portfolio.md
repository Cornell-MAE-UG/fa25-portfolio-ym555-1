For this assignment, I used the heat exchanger lab as a real-world instance to show how energy is transferred. 
The setup of this system included:

- Heat exchanger, where the energy transfer occurred
- Pumps, which moved the liquid up through the pipes
- Pipes, which held the liquid that moved from the initial container
- Cold water, dyed blue
- Hot water, dyed red
- Containers to hold the water

Here is a visual setup of the system:

My group and I decided to test the design performance of counterflow vs. parallel flow. We conducted both designs twice to see if the outcomes were consistent enough to draw a more accurate conclusion. Our main question was which design resulted in a more efficient energy transfer between the two liquids. 

## Counterflow
First, we conducted the counterflow design. 
Here is a visual setup of the design and the direction of flow for each water:
