## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a student pursuing a major in Mechanical Engineering. I am passionate about design and thinking critically about real world probelms. Hopefully, my mechanical skills will be able to develope and contribute to the future. I enjoy creating designs, making CAD models, and getting my hands dirty to create stuff. Recently, I am transitioning from Fusion360 to SolidWorks by doing projects for CUAir (Cornell University Unmanned Air Systems). My current project includes working on wing internals and researching ribs optimization before Critical Design Review.

Outside of Mechanical Engineering, my interests include traveling, fashion, drawing/painting, photography, and baking. In general, I like to try new things.
